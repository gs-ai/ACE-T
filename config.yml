# ACE-T Configuration
# Place your Reddit API credentials here for authenticated access
# Get credentials from: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

# ====================================================================
# SECURITY NOTICE: Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Credentials
# ====================================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: Never commit real API credentials to version control!
#
# The application code (src/runners/reddit_live_ingest.py) automatically gives PRIORITY
# to environment variables over config file values for security.
#
# RECOMMENDED APPROACH (most secure):
#   1. Set environment variables before running the application:
#      export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_actual_client_id"
#      export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_actual_secret"
#      export REDDIT_USER_AGENT="ACE-T:v2.0.0 (by /u/yourname)"
#   
#   2. Leave placeholder values in this config.yml (as shown below)
#
# The application checks for environment variables first, then falls back
# to config.yml values only if environment variables are not set.
#
# For production deployments, use secure secret management solutions
# like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets.

reddit:
  # Required for authenticated API access
  # SECURITY: Set environment variables REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET instead of hardcoding credentials here
  # The values below are placeholders - the application will use environment variables if they are set
  client_id: ""  # Placeholder - set REDDIT_CLIENT_ID environment variable with your Reddit app client ID
  client_secret: ""  # Placeholder - set REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable with your Reddit app secret
  user_agent: "ACE-T:v2.0.0 (by /u/sirarthurconand)"  # Custom user agent

  # Optional: Rate limiting (requests per minute)
  rate_limit_per_minute: 60

  # Fallback settings for unauthenticated access
  fallback_enabled: true
  fallback_base_delay: 5.0  # seconds between requests
  fallback_max_retries: 3

# Other configuration sections can be added here as needed

# Data retention: maximum age (in days) for nodes/edges written to the graph
# Can be overridden by env var ACE_T_RETENTION_DAYS
retention_days: 30

# Realtime open feeds: comment out any feed to disable it
